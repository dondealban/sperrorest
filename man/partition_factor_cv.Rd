\title{Partition the data for a (non-spatial) k-fold cross-validation at the group
level}
\usage{
partition_factor_cv(data, coords = c("x", "y"), fac, nfold = 10,
  repetition = 1, seed1 = NULL, return.factor = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} containing at least the columns specified
by \code{coords}}

\item{coords}{vector of length 2 defining the variables in \code{data}
that contain the x and y coordinates of sample locations.}

\item{fac}{either the name of a variable (column) in \code{data}, or a
vector of type factor and length \code{nrow(data)} that defines groups or
clusters of observations.}

\item{nfold}{number of partitions (folds) in \code{nfold}-fold
cross-validation partitioning}

\item{repetition}{numeric vector: cross-validation repetitions
to be generated. Note that this is not the number of repetitions,
but the indices of these repetitions. E.g., use \code{repetition = c(1:100)}
to obtain (the 'first') 100 repetitions, and \code{repetition = c(101:200)}
to obtain a different set of 100 repetitions.}

\item{seed1}{\code{seed1+i} is the random seed that will be used by
\code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}} in repetition \code{i} (\code{i} in \code{repetition})
to initialize the random number generator before sampling from the data set.}

\item{return.factor}{if \code{FALSE} (default), return a
\code{\link[=represampling]{represampling()}} object; if \code{TRUE} (used internally by
other \code{sperrorest} functions), return a \code{list} containing factor
vectors (see Value)}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[=represampling]{represampling()}} object,
see also \code{\link[=partition_cv]{partition_cv()}} for details.
}
\description{
\code{partition_factor_cv} creates a \code{\link[=represampling]{represampling()}} object,
i.e. a set of sample indices defining cross-validation test and training sets,
where partitions are obtained by resampling at the level of groups of
observations as defined by a given factor variable.
This can be used, for example, to resample agricultural data that is grouped
by fields, at the agricultural field level in order to preserve
spatial autocorrelation within fields.
}
\note{
In this partitioning approach, the number of factor levels in
\code{fac} must be large enough for this factor-level resampling to make
sense.
